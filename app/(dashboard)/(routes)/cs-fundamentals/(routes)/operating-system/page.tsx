        //                         Operating System (OS) is basically a software program that manages and handles all resources of a computer such as hardware and software. It takes care of everything the computer needs to work, both the physical parts (like the screen and keyboard) and the invisible parts (like the programs running in the background). The first OS was introduced in the early 1950s and was called GMOs. The OS helps people interact with the computer and makes sure it runs smoothly.

        //                             The Operating System (OS) is like the heart of a computer â€“ it's incredibly important. Without it, a computer is practically useless. The OS serves as a connection between the software installed on the computer and the people using it. It helps in talking to the hardware and ensures a balance between all the different parts, including the CPU. The OS provides services to users and a platform for programs to run. In simple terms, it does all the common tasks that applications need to work smoothly.

        //                             The main purpose of an Operating System (OS) is to run the programs people use and make computers easier for us to understand. It helps us interact with computers and run applications smoothly. The OS is like a special manager that ensures the computer works well by handling all its tasks. It takes care of computer memory, processes, and makes sure all the hardware and software work together.
